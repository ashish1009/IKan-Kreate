## Getting Started
XCode 14.3 is recommended

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/ashish1009/IKan-Kreate`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

## IKan Library
IKan Library can be used independently to develop your own Editor/Game

### How to Use the library
`{...} directory where IKan Engine is cloned`
  - Link the libikan.a in your project...

### Preprocessors

### Header Search Paths

## Kreator
Kreator is an editor used to develop games using IKan Library and other submodules

## Release
v {IKanVersion}.{IKanSubVersion}.{KreatorVersion}.{KreatorSubVersion}
